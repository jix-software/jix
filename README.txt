JIX (aka. Javascript, Interactive, and eXtensible) is a Javascript toolkit
meant to enable the development of simple and evolveable software.

It is made of a set of combinable mini-languages that enable setting up and
developing simple apps mostly without programming, and of a set of orthogonal
libraries that enable extending these simple apps by means of Javascript code
to develop more sophisticated designs. This provides an excellent basis to
develop modern, leightweight webapps in an incremental fashion.

JIX is free software. It is released under the LGPLv3.
